# Etten\Doctrine

Provides some helpers and extension for Doctrine 2 ORM into Nette Framework.

## Installation

First install package via Composer:

```
$ composer require etten/doctrine
```

Then register basic DI Extension in `config.neon`:

```
extensions:
	etten.doctrine: Etten\Doctrine\DI\DIExtension
```

## EntityManager Facades

Doctrine's default EntityManager is a GOD class. Monster. It does too much, violates SRP, mocks are difficilt, ...

But you can use:

* **Etten\Doctrine\Facade** (abstract class)
* **Etten\Doctrine\Persister**
* **Etten\Doctrine\RepositoryLocator**
* **Etten\Doctrine\Transaction**

Services are registered automatically with `Etten\Doctrine\DI\DIExtension`.

## Helpers

### FieldOrderHelper

Sometimes, you need sort items by order given by another array.
 
In MySQL, you can use [ORDER BY FIELD](http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/109120/how-does-order-by-field-in-mysql-work-internally).

But when we use Doctrine, our code should be platform independent and we shouldn't use DBMS-specific functions directly.

You can sort items in PHP via `Etten\Doctrine\Helpers\FieldOrderHelper`. See [implementation](src/Helpers/FieldOrderHelper.php).

*Note: This kind of operations in PHP is inefficient. Use it only for few filtered items.*
*If you have hundreds of items, rather rewrite the code and sort items directly in DBMS, not in PHP.*

### Randomizer

Randomizer helps you find random-look results without `ORDER BY RAND()` clause.

It counts all items in given `Query` object and selects random offset.

Then applies limit and returns items as a shuffled array result.

*For better results, offset + limit is performed in multiple iterations (by default for each 25 items).*
*It increases a cost of the operation, but results are not in order as-inserted into database.*

## Extensions

### UUID

If you need item's ID before persist and flush, you can use [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) as a primary index.

Doctrine 2 has native support of UUID (GUID) but it's auto-generated value by RDMS. And we don't know the ID before persist and flush.

But you can generate UUID before persist and flush, in PHP.

For more information see [ramsey/uuid-doctrine](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid-doctrine).

You can add the UUID support by registering a Nette DI extension:

```yaml
# app/config.neon

extensions:
	etten.doctrine.uuid: Etten\Doctrine\DI\UuidExtension
```

### InstanceId

If you need item's ID before persist and flush, you can use [InstanceId](src/Entities/Attributes/InstanceId) as a primary index.

It's globally unique integer generated by PHP, not RDMS.

You can add the InstanceId support by registering a Nette DI extension:

```yaml
# app/config.neon

extensions:
	etten.doctrine.instanceId: Etten\Doctrine\DI\InstanceIdExtension

etten.doctrine.instanceId:
	path: safe://%storageDir%/instance-generator.id
```

## DQL

### MySQL MATCH AGAINST

The original source of the code is [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17536071/4827632).

Register a DQL in config:

```yaml
# app/config.neon

kdyby.doctrine:
	dql:
		string:
			MATCH: Etten\Doctrine\DQL\MatchAgainstFunction

```

Usage:

```php
<?php

public function search(string $q)
{
	$q = $this->createJoinedQueryBuilder()
		->addSelect('MATCH (a.title) AGAINST (:search) as HIDDEN score')
		->addWhere('MATCH (a.title) AGAINST (:search) > 1')
		->setParameter('search', $q)
		->orderBy('score', 'desc');

	return new Paginator($q);
}

```
